# Medical Imaging Model Hub (MHub)

Making machine learning models for medical imaging available through a standardized I/O framework.

MHub is still being developed, so bear with us if some functionalities are still not implemented or to be improved. MHub is developed by researchers for researchers, and thus we welcome and appreciate any feedback that can help improve the platform (so feel free to [open an Issue on GitHub](https://github.com/AIM-Harvard/mhub/issues/new) with your suggestions).

# About MHub 🤖🏥🐳

MHub is a repository of self-contained deep learning models pretrained for a wide variety of applications in the medical imaging domain. MHub highlights recent trends in deep learning applications and promotes reproducible science, empowering AI researchers to share fully reproducible and portable model implementations.

**MHub models are:**

- **Peer-reviewed.** All the models in MHub are accompanied by peer-reviewed studies published in scientific journals. Integrating MHub models in your analysis pipelines means integrating AI models which results are backed by published studies.

- **Framework-agnostic.** As MHub is built using Docker, by nature it is framework agnostic and supports all numerical computing backends. Packaging a model in MHub means providing the community with a tool that will work out of the box as intended by the developers.

- **Documented and tested.** Together with the models, we provide instructions on how to run the containers on your system and example use-cases of our models running on the cloud on publicly available data from [The Imaging Data Commons](https://portal.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/).

# Installation

MHub is based on Docker, which is a platform and technology that allows developers to package their applications and all their dependencies into portable containers, making it easy to deploy and run on any machine that supports Docker.

Therefore, as long as the node has Docker installed, MHub models can run anywhere - on a laptop, on a research workstation in a hospital, on a research server or in the cloud.

## Install on Linux 

To install docker on Linux, you can follow Docker's official documentation at:

https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/

There are also plenty of unofficial guided tutorials on the internet depending on OS you are running. Most likely, installing Docker from scratch will take a basic understanding of the terminal, a few instructions and a few minutes.

Alternatively, the user can also install Docker Desktop following the OS-specific guide found at the webpage linked above. 

For instance, for systems running Ubuntu:

https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/ubuntu/

> Docker Desktop includes the Docker daemon (dockerd), the Docker client (docker), Docker Compose, Docker Content Trust, Kubernetes, and Credential Helper.

## Install on Windows

To install docker on Windows, please follow Docker's official documentation at:

https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/

Please, note that:

> While Docker Desktop on Windows can be run without having Administrator privileges, it does require them during installation. On installation the user gets a UAC prompt which allows a privileged helper service to be installed. After that, Docker Desktop can be run by users without administrator privileges, provided they are members of the docker-users group. The user who performs the installation is automatically added to this group, but other users must be added manually. This allows the administrator to control who has access to Docker Desktop.

# Usage

## Running MHub Containers from CLI

### Pulling Containers from Dockerhub

All the MHub images are multi-platform whenever possible, and [made available through Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repositories/mhubai). Since pulling images from Dockerhub is considerably faster than building images on your system, we advise you do so if you don't have platform-related issues.

Assuming you want to try the `totalsegmentator` container without CUDA support (`mhubai/totalsegmentator:cuda12.0`), and the DICOM Series you want to process is stored at `$PATH_TO_DICOM_SERIES_FOLDER`, and you want to store the output of the model at `$PATH_TO_OUTPUT_FOLDER`, and:

```
docker run \
--volume $PATH_TO_DICOM_SERIES_FOLDER:/app/data/input_data \
--volume $PATH_TO_OUTPUT_FOLDER:/app/data/output_data
--gpus all \
mhubai/totalsegmentator:cuda12.0
```


```
time docker run \
  --volume /home/dennis/Desktop/sample_data/input_dcm:/app/data/input_data \
  --volume /home/dennis/Desktop/sample_data/output_data/totalsegmentator:/app/data/output_data \
  --gpus all mhubai/totalsegmentator:cuda12.0

### Building Containers Locally

If for some reason (e.g., platform compatibility) you would like to build the MHub containers locally, you can do so in a couple of very simple steps.

First, `cd` in the directory storing the dockerfile of the container you're interested to. The MHub containers are provided both without CUDA support (`nocuda`) and with CUDA support (`cudaXX.X`, .e.g, `cuda12.0`) whenever possible:

```
cd git/mhub/mhub/totalsegmentator/dockerfiles/nocuda
```

Once you find yourself in the correct directory, you can build the container by simply running:

```
docker build . --no-cache --tag $CONTAINER_NAME
```

If you want to [specify the platform to build for](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/), you're free to do so using the `--platform` argument.

You will now be able to run the container as explained in the "Pulling Containers from Dockerhub" section above.

## Integration with 3D Slicer

# Contributing to MHub

We want to make MHub crowdsourced through contributions by the scientific research community.

We are in the process of developing tools to allow researchers and developers to contribute to MHub with the models they developed.

# Known Issues

## Docker Support of Machines with AppleSilicon (e.g., M1 Processors)

The users building Docker containers on Apple Silicon devices still face some issues, as documented in many blogposts all over the web.

For instance, some packages might not have an available candidate for installation if you try to build a Linux-based Docker image on an M1 macbook:

```
# build the mhubai base image without CUDA support
cd git/mhub/mhub/dockerfiles/nocuda

If you want to know more, there are some [very relevant posts about this exact issue](https://groups.google.com/g/plastimatch/c/IGpuVP5ZLm8?pli=1).

The only way this problem can be solved is by running the `docker build` command specifying the platform, with the `--platform` flag. In our case, passing the argument `--platform linux/amd64` will result in a successful build, with the caveat that all the libraries installed in the Docker container will of course not be optimized for the Apple Silicon processor. This practically means that running computationally intensive tasks (e.g., the `mhubai/totalsegmentator:nocuda` image) will take approximately 10 times longer than what it would take if AppleSilicon-optimized libraries were parsed.
